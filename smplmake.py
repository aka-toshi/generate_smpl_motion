Please Note:
============
This is a demo version of the script for driving the SMPL model with python.
We would be happy to receive comments, help and suggestions on improving this code 
and in making it available on more platforms. 


System Requirements:
====================
Operating system: OSX, Linux

Python Dependencies:
- Numpy & Scipy  [http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html]
- Chumpy [https://github.com/mattloper/chumpy]


About the Script:
=================
This script demonstrates a few basic functions to help users get started with using 
the SMPL model. The code shows how to:
  - Load the SMPL model
  - Edit pose & shape parameters of the model to create a new body in a new pose
  - Save the resulting body as a mesh in .OBJ format


Running the Hello World code:
=============================
Inside Terminal, navigate to the smpl/webuser/hello_world directory. You can run 
the hello world script now by typing the following:
>	python hello_smpl.py

'''

from smpl_webuser.serialization import load_model
import numpy as np
import sys

def main(name):
    ## Load SMPL model (here we load the female model)
    ## Make sure path is correct
    m = load_model( '/Users/akase/smpl/smpl_webuser/hello_world/basicModel_m_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl' )
    
    ### Assign random pose and shape parameters
    #m.pose[:] = np.random.rand(m.pose.size) * .2
    #m.betas[:] = np.random.rand(m.betas.size) * .03
    
    #自分で作った
#    theta = np.loadtxt('/Users/akase/smpl/smpl_webuser/hello_world/theta/theta.csv',delimiter=',')
    theta = np.loadtxt('exp/theta/theta'+name+'.csv',delimiter=',')
    m.pose[:] = theta[3:75]
    m.betas[:] = theta[75:]
    
    ## Write to an .obj file
    outmesh_path = 'exp/objdata/'+name+'.obj'
    with open( outmesh_path, 'w') as fp:
        for v in m.r:
            fp.write( 'v %f %f %f\n' % ( v[0], v[1], v[2]) )
    
        for f in m.f+1: # Faces are 1-based, not 0-based in obj files
            fp.write( 'f %d %d %d\n' %  (f[0], f[1], f[2]) )
    
    ## Print message
    print '..Output mesh saved to: ', outmesh_path 
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    args = sys.argv
    main(args[1])
